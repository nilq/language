## Syntax-teaser

Coming to a repo and seeing nothing but a todo-list is kinda sad. Here is some syntax I just used for testing.

Executes flawlessly in 0.00s.

```
func fib -> {
    | 0 => 0
    | 1 => 1
    | n => fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
}

print fib(12)
```

## Todo

- [x] Pretty fast single-pass parser/compiler.
- [x] Virtual machine and compact bytecode format.
- [x] Pattern-matching functions with name-mangling.
- [x] Rust FFI.
- [x] IMPORTANT: Fallback-function to get hard-to-predict values.
- [Â ] Goto and flow-control.
- [ ] Lazy evaluation/compilation.
- [ ] Nice errors.
- [ ] More compact bytecode-output.
- [ ] `polar`-datatypes.
